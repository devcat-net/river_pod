`StateProvider` is a provider that exposes a way to modify its state.
It is a simplification of [StateNotifierProvier], designed to avoid
having to write a [StateNotifier] class for very simple use-cases.

`StateProvider` exists primarily to allow the modification of
**simple** variables by the User Interface.  
The state of a `StateProvider` is typically one of:

- an enum, such as a filter type
- a String, typically the raw content of a text field
- a boolean, for checkboxes
- a number, for pagination or age form fields

You should not use `StateProvider` if:

- your state needs a validation logic
- your state is a complex object (such as a custom class, a list/map, ...)
- the logic for modifying your state is more advanced than a simple `count++`.

For more advanced cases, consider using [StateNotifierProvider] instead and
create a [StateNotifier] class.  
While the initial boilerplate will be a bit larger, having a custom
[StateNotifier] class is critical for the long-term maintainability of your
project â€“ as it centralizes the business logic of your state in a single place.

## Usage example: Changing the filter type using a dropdown

A real-world use-case of `StateProvider` would be to manage the state of
simple form components like dropdowns/text fields/checkboxes.  
In particular, we will see how to use `StateProvider` to implement a dropdown
which allows changing how a list of products is sorted.

For the sake of simplicity, the list of products that we will obtain
will be built directly in the application and be as followed:

```dart
class Product {
  Product({required this.name, required this.price});

  final String name;
  final double price;
}

final _products = [
  Product(name: 'iPhone', price: 999),
  Product(name: 'cookie', price: 2),
  Product(name: 'ps5', price: 500),
];

final productsProvider = Provider<List<Product>>((ref) {
  return _products;
});
```

In a real-world application, this list would typically be obtained using
[FutureProvider] by making a network request.

The User Interface could then show the list of products by doing:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  final products = ref.watch(productsProvider);
  return Scaffold(
    body: ListView.builder(
      itemCount: products.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index) {
        final product = products[index];
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(product.name),
          subtitle: Text('${product.price} \$'),
        );
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

Now that we're done with the base, we can add a dropdown, which will
allow filtering our products either by price or by name.  
For that, we will use [DropDownButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DropdownButton-class.html).

```dart
// An enum representing the filter type
enum ProductSortType {
  name,
  price,
}

Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  final products = ref.watch(productsProvider);
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('Products'),
      actions: [
        DropdownButton<ProductSortType>(
          value: ProductSortType.price,
          onChanged: (value) {},
          items: [
            DropdownMenuItem(
              value: ProductSortType.name,
              child: Icon(Icons.sort_by_alpha),
            ),
            DropdownMenuItem(
              value: ProductSortType.price,
              child: Icon(Icons.sort),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    ),
    body: ListView.builder(
      // ...
    ),
  );
}
```

Now that we have a dropdown, let's create a `StateProvider` and
synchronize the state of the dropdown with our provider.

First, let's create the `StateProvider`:

```dart
final productSortTypeProvider = StateProvider<ProductSortType>(
  // We return the default sort type, here name.
  (ref) => ProductSortType.name,
);
```

Then, we can connect this provider with our dropdown by doing:

```dart
 DropdownButton<ProductSortType>(
  // When the sort type changes, this will rebuild the dropdown
  // to update the icon shown.
  value: ref.watch(productSortTypeProvider),
  // When the user interacts with the dropdown, we update the provider state.
  onChanged: (value) => ref.read(productSortTypeProvider.notifier).state = value,
  items: [
    // ...
  ],
),
```

With this, we should now be able to change the sort type.  
It has no impact on the list of products yet though! It's now time for the
final part: Updating our `productsProvider` to sort the list of products.

A key component of implementing this is to use [ref.watch], to have
our `productsProvider` obtain the sort type and recompute the list of
products whenever the sort type changes.

The implementation would be:

```dart
final productsProvider = Provider<List<Product>>((ref) {
  final sortType = ref.watch(productSortTypeProvider);
  switch (sortType) {
    case ProductSortType.name:
      return _products.sorted((a, b) => a.name.compareTo(b.name));
    case ProductSortType.price:
      return _products.sorted((a, b) => a.price.compareTo(b.price));
  }
});
```

That's all! This change is enough for the User Interface to automatically
re-render the list of products when the sort type changes.
